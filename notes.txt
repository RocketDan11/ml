types of learning/training
----
supervised - learning: uses a series of labeled examples. you have the correct answers
unsupervised learning - you do not have the correct answer. uses a series of labeled examples with direct feedback. the most common learning approach 


reinforcement learning - trained through many iterations, using a gain function to determine whether output is better or worse than desired.

semi supervised - partially labeled samples and possibly (a lot of ) unlabeled samples .
