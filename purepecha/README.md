# Echoes of the Past: Preserving Purépecha through English Translation

## Project Summary

This project introduces an innovative machine learning tool that translates English into Pur´epecha, a unique
indigenous Mesoamerican language. By leveraging authentic linguistic data—sourced from historical church
records and academic theses—the project developed a neural network with advanced attention mechanisms.
This ensures that both everyday expressions and complex sentences are translated accurately while preserv-
ing the rich cultural nuances intrinsic to Purepecha.

## Broader Impact

The translator is not merely a technological achievement; it represents a vital step in preserving an endan-
gered language and the cultural heritage it embodies. By making Pur´epecha more accessible, the project
fosters enhanced communication among language learners, researchers, and native community members.
This work exemplifies how state-of-the-art machine learning techniques can be applied to safeguard indige-
nous languages, serving as a blueprint for similar initiatives worldwide. In doing so, it contributes to broader
efforts in cultural preservation, linguistic diversity, and academic research on endangered languages.
